frequency-2575-2595MHz, frequency-2635-2655MHz and frequency-1880-1900MHz contain captured I&Q data at target center frequency.

*.it are captured by CellSearch (https://github.com/Evrytania/LTE-Cell-Scanner)
*.bin are captured by rtl_sdr (http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr)

Three it files (0000, 0001, 0002) are from lower(-100kHz) exact and higher(+100kHz) frequencies.

Example rules of bin file name:

f2645_s1.92_g0_1s.bin

    frequency -- 2645MHz
sampling rate -- 1.92MHz
         gain -- 0 (automatic gain)
           1s -- length of capture period
